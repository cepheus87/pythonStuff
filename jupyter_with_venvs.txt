Create and activate virtual environment and then

(python -m) pip install ipykernel

ipython kernell install --user --name=ProjectName


To make sure that "right" python is used:
Search for jupyter kernels:

jupyter kernelspec list

Then check in kernel.json (in your venv kernel path) path to python which is used in given kernel. Sometimes it must be changed for ".../your_venv/bin/python"
