pandas eval() and query()

eval() works for data frames (pandas.eval()) and for columns (DataFrame.eval())

eval for calculations
query for conditions

Performance:

It improves memory usage - no temporary df need to be created.

!!! Time performance are more or less the same for the same conditional BUT for small arrays are even worse !!!
