requirements:
setuptools
wheel

python3.6 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

It creates:
tar.gz - source archive
whl - built distribution


to install:
pip install some-package.whl


tar.gz is the source code of the library. You should unpack it, and you will find a setup.py script inside. Run:

`python setup.py install --prefix=/share/pythonLib`

This will create:

`/share/pythonLib/lib/python2.7/site-packages/`

In your scripts append that path to sys.path and everything should work fine.
