simple debugger (console like)

%debug and the iPython debugger

The easiest way to debug a Jupyter notebook is to use the %debug magic command. Whenever you encounter an error or exception, just open a new notebook cell, type %debug and run the cell. This will open a command line where you can test your code and inspect all variables right up to the line that threw the error.
Type “n” and hit Enter to run the next line of code (The → arrow shows you the current position). Use “c” to continue until the next breakpoint. “q” quits the debugger and code execution.

or set breakpoint in code
from IPython.core.debugger import set_trace

code ...
set_trace()
code ...
